Q: A coin is heads up. Jeff does not flip the coin. Jen flips the coin. Giselle flips the coin. Noel does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?
A: The question can be simplified to: It is known that S = A = 1. Jeff does not flip the coin, so A = A = 1;  Jen flips the coin, so A = -A = -1; Giselle flips the coin, so A = -A = -(-1) = 1; Noel does not flip the coin, so A = A = 1. Since now A is equal to S, so the coin is still head up.
So the answer is: yes
Q: A coin is heads up. Wilmer flips the coin. Valerie does not flip the coin. Melissa flips the coin. Eloisa flips the coin. Is the coin still heads up?
