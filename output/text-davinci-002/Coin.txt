 The question can be simplified to: It is known that S = A = 1. Rich flips the coin, so A = -A = -1; Parker does not flip the coin, so A = A = -1; Edward flips the coin, so A = -A = -(-1) = 1; Milagros flips the coin, so A = -A = -1. Since now A is not equal to S, so the coin is not still head up.
So the answer is: no
ground truth: no
