Jaymie says Andree lies: lies -> B' = 0. Since B = 0, B is equal to B', so C = 1.
Inga says Jaymie lies: lies -> C' = 0. Since C = 1, C is not equal to C', so D = 0.
Millicent says Inga tells the truth: truth -> D' = 1. Since D = 0, D is not equal to D', so E = 0.
Since E = 0, so the answer is: no.
ground truth: No
