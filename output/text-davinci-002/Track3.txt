First, C and B swap balls: C and B -> (C = 3, B = 2 -> C = 2, B = 3) -> A = 1, B = 3, C = 2.
Then, B and A swap balls: B and A -> (B = 3, A = 1 -> B = 1, A = 3) -> A = 3, B = 1, C = 2.
Finally, C and A swap balls: C and A -> (C = 2, A = 3 -> C = 3, A = 2) -> A = 2, B = 1, C = 3.
At the end of the game, Alice has the: Alice -> A = 2, 2 -> the 2-nd option -> the answer is (B).
ground truth: (B)
